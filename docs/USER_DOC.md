# ls-compat user documentation

## Core system

Load `ls-compat` for UTF-8 conversion and deadline handling.

```lisp
(ql:quickload :ls-compat)

(ls-compat:utf8-string-to-octets "Příliš žluťoučký kůň")
(ls-compat:utf8-octets-to-string #(104 101 108 108 111))

(ls-compat:with-timeout 2
  (perform-operation))
```

`utf8-string-to-octets` and `utf8-octets-to-string` accept optional `:start`
and `:end` bounds. They always use UTF-8 and do not depend on the implementation
external format.

`finite-float-p` returns true only for a finite float. It rejects NaN and
infinite values before a protocol serializes them as JSON numbers.

`call-with-timeout` receives a number of seconds, or `nil`, and a nullary
function. `with-timeout` is its body form. A completed body returns all of its
values. A deadline signals `ls-compat:timeout-expired`; inspect its requested
duration with `ls-compat:timeout-expired-seconds`.

A `nil` deadline does not install a timeout. An implementation that cannot
provide a safe timeout signals `ls-compat:unsupported-operation`. Its operation
name is available through `ls-compat:unsupported-operation-name`.

## POSIX system

Load `ls-compat/posix` only for Unix process and permission APIs.

```lisp
(ql:quickload :ls-compat/posix)

(ls-compat.posix:current-process-id)
(ls-compat.posix:process-alive-p process-id)
(ls-compat.posix:process-group-id process-id)
(ls-compat.posix:process-group-alive-p process-group-id)
(ls-compat.posix:signal-process-group process-group-id :terminate)
(ls-compat.posix:make-directory-exclusively #p"/tmp/example" :mode #o700)
(setf (ls-compat.posix:file-mode #p"/tmp/example") #o700)
```

`make-directory-exclusively` is atomic. It signals the underlying OSICAT POSIX
condition if the directory already exists or cannot be created. `file-mode`
reads and writes raw POSIX mode bits. The operating-system umask may restrict
the mode supplied when a directory is created.

`process-alive-p` uses `kill(pid, 0)`. It is a snapshot, not process identity:
a PID can be reused. A process that exists but cannot be signaled due to
permissions counts as alive.

`process-group-id` returns a process's POSIX group identifier.
`process-group-alive-p` uses `kill(-pgid, 0)` and has the same snapshot and
permission semantics. `signal-process-group` sends `:terminate` or `:kill` to
every member of the group. It propagates an OSICAT POSIX condition when the
operation cannot be completed.

## TCP system

Load `ls-compat/tcp` for simple client and listener lifecycle operations.

```lisp
(ql:quickload :ls-compat/tcp)

(let ((listener (ls-compat.tcp:tcp-listen "127.0.0.1" 0)))
  (unwind-protect
       (let ((port (ls-compat.tcp:tcp-local-port listener)))
         ;; Pass PORT to a client, then accept its connection.
         (multiple-value-bind (socket address port)
             (ls-compat.tcp:tcp-accept listener)
           (declare (ignore address port))
           (unwind-protect
                (ls-compat.tcp:tcp-stream socket)
             (ls-compat.tcp:close-tcp socket))))
    (ls-compat.tcp:close-tcp listener)))
```

`tcp-connect` returns a USOCKET socket. `tcp-listen` returns a listener and
uses a backlog of 16, address reuse, and `(unsigned-byte 8)` streams by default.
Pass `:element-type` to request another stream element type. `tcp-accept`
returns the accepted socket, peer address, and peer port. `tcp-stream` returns
the socket's bidirectional stream. `tcp-local-port` returns the bound local
port. Always release sockets and listeners with `close-tcp`.

The TCP APIs deliberately expose the underlying socket object as an opaque
value. Do not rely on its representation; pass it only to this system or close
it with `close-tcp`.
